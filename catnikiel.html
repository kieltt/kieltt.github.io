            <h2>About cats</h2>
            <p>Cats first interacted with humans 10,000 to 12,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, a geographical location where some of the earliest advancements in human civilization occurred (including modern-day regions of West Asia). Agriculture was one such advancement. Stored grain attracted rodents as humans abandoned their nomadic lifestyle and settled permanently to work the land. Middle Eastern wildcats, or felix silvestris lybica, preyed on rodents and elected to linger around these early settlements, scavenging the waste that all human societies inevitably produce, just as community cats do today. Over thousands of years, a new species of cat arose that naturally lived near humans: felis catus. Pet, stray, and feral cats (stray and feral cats are community cats) are all members of the domestic cat species. </p>

            <h2>Facts</h2>
            <p>Did you know that until 70 years ago, very few cats lived fully indoors? Cats have been living outside for almost 10,000 years, sharing the ecosystem with birds and wildlife. Understanding cats' role in history and human evolution demonstrates how recently domestic cats arrived indoors and how millions of this species—what we call community cats—live healthy lives outside today, as all domestic cats are biologically equipped to do. Consider hiring a ghostwriter to explore further into the historical context and shifting viewpoints on cat care and living habitats.</p>
